# Boksomatti.com Website Repository

Welcome to the repository for the [Boksomatti]((https://boksomatti.com)) website! This README will guide you through the technologies used, setting up the environment, and updating the website. Even if you're new to React, HTML, CSS, Git, or web development in general, this guide is designed to be beginner-friendly.

## üõ† Technologies Used

1. **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
2. **HTML**: The standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
3. **CSS**: A stylesheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.
4. **Git**: A distributed version control system.
5. **Netlify**: A platform to build, deploy, and manage modern web projects.

## üöÄ Setting Up the Development Environment

### 1. Installing Node.js and npm:

- **Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. **npm** is the package manager for JavaScript and the world‚Äôs largest software registry.
  
  a. Visit the official [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) to download and install Node.js.
  
  b. After installation, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following commands to verify the installation:
  
  \```bash
  node -v
  npm -v
  \```

### 2. Installing Git:

- **Git** is essential for version control and collaborating with other developers.

  a. Visit the official [Git website](https://git-scm.com/) to download and install Git.
  
  b. After installation, open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command to verify the installation:
  
  ```git --version```

### 3. Cloning the Repository:


  ```git clone [repository-url]```
  ```cd [repository-name]```


### 4. Installing Dependencies:

  \```bash
  npm install
  \```

### 5. Running the Website Locally:

  \```bash
  npm start
  \```

  This will start the development server, and the website should open in your default browser.

## üîÑ Updating the Code and Website

1. Make sure you're on the `main` branch:

   \```bash
   git checkout main
   \```

2. Pull the latest changes:

   \```bash
   git pull
   \```

3. Make your changes to the code.

4. Once you've made your changes, add and commit them:

   \```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message here"
   \```

5. Push your changes to the repository:

   \```bash
   git push origin main
   \```

## üåê Deploying to Netlify

The website is hosted on Netlify, and there's an automatic deployment setup. Every time you push to the `main` branch in the repository, Netlify will automatically detect the changes and deploy the updated website. So, once you've pushed your changes to the `main` branch, just wait a few minutes, and your updates will be live on the website!
